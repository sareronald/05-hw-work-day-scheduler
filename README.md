05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Contents
<p>
This Work Day Scheduler is composed of 4 pages: index.html, script.js and style.css. The folder also includes some images of the application in /05-hw-screenshots.
</p>

## User Story
<p>
The purpose of this project was to create a simple calender application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day and manage their time effectively. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery. The [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library will be used to work with date and time. 
</p> 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
